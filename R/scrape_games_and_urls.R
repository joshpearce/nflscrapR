#' Scrape game ids for a given NFL season (either pre, regular, or post-season) 
#' 
#' This function returns all available game ids for a given season,
#' with an option specifying which type of game ids to return (either the 
#' pre, regular, or post season) as well as the weeks considered.
#' 
#' @param season Numeric 4-digit year associated with an NFL season
#' @param type String indicating the type of game ids to find, must either be
#' "pre", "reg", or "post" (default is "reg").
#' @param weeks Numeric vector indicating which weeks of preseason (0 to 4 except
#' for 2011 season without Hall of Fame game) or regular season games (1 to 17)
#' to grab (default value of NULL corresponds to selecting all available weeks).
#' @param teams String vector indicating which teams (based on the abbreviation)
#' the function should grab game info for (default value of NULL corresponds to
#' selecting all available teams).
#' @return Data frame with columns containing the season type, game_id, week number (if
#' pre or regular season), the year of the season, home team, away team, a variable
#' indicating the state of the game (POST is over, PRE is before or during),
#' game's url, and the home and away team scores if the game is over.
